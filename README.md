# MSD_Feature-Extraction-and-Machine-Learning
 Loudness analysis and Machine learning prediction based on Million Song Dataset provided by Columbia University
 ##Music and Machine Learning –

Script that extracts information from a dataset and makes predictions using machine learning algorithims
Developed in Python.
Utilizes machine learning algorithms in the scikit-learn library to predict genres of songs based on a song’s dataset of average loudness, max loudness, and peak loudness.
Supervised learning done on dataset of songs provided by the Million Song Dataset by Columbia University. http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/
